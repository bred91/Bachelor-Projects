### Project 1
We want to create an application that, given a user code and a medicine as input, returns a compatibility (true) or an incompatibility (false) between the two, through a check between ingredients and allergies.

One possible application is in the pharmaceutical context.
In other words, implementing the application within the pharmacy's computer system and performing an automatic check on the purchase of a generic product.
More generally, a database and a national network could be evaluated, in which the various users are identified by their health card.

Tech: Prolog
Note: you may notice that the documents and some port of the code are in italian
