### Classification of biomedical images using local descriptors
This project is my bachelor thesis work and is focused on the classification of biomedical images through local descriptors.
The problem at hand is to use Machine Learning algorithms for the prediction of a diagnosis from descriptors (features) obtained from tumour cell nuclei extracted by means of FNA (Fine Needle Aspiration).

Tech: Python
Note: Suddenly, I lost the definitive version of the code. The one uploaded is just a draft intermediate one.
