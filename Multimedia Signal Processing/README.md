### Camera model identification
This is the folder of the projects made by me, A. De Crecchio, U. Giordano, and C. Pulcrano for the course of Multimedia Signal Processing at Federico II.

"The objective of this project is the identification of the camera model that captured a given photograph.<br>
Approaches that recognise the camera model are based on the traces left in the image by the sequence of processing within each camera and specific to the particular model. These traces are not visible and in order to highlight them it is necessary to suppress the content of the scene by means of a high pass filter. For this project it will use local descriptors based on co-occurrences, which represent a powerful tool to describe micro-patterns in the image for camera identification. These descriptors will be used to train a linear classifier."

Tech: Matlab<br>
